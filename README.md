## Inspiration


## What it does

## How we built it
We used HTML and CSS for the front-end, and for the back-end, we used wolfam alpha and NASA APIs, and also used flask framework for python.
## Challenges we ran into
For some of us, it was difficult using APIs, so learning new things as we made the website was interesting and challenging at the same time. We ran into lots of issues like the API connection between python and HTML. :(


## Accomplishments that we're proud of


## What we learned
We learned how to use APIs. 

## What's next for Galactic Origins
Weâ€™re definitely looking forward to our next hackathons! Also, we will add some more APIs further in time and make it a more robust website than it has ever been.

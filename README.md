## Inspiration
Our inspiration was our enthusiasm for astronomy. As astronomy is a subject that is not taught in most the high schools, many children have questions regarding it. Therefore, this website answers all your problems concerning space and astronomy. 

## What it does
The user can ask an astronomy-related question and get an answer using the APIs we connected it to. There is also an option to view a picture of space from NASA API which refreshes daily to add to user interest.

## How we built it
We used HTML and CSS for the front-end, and for the back-end, we used Wolfam Alpha and NASA APIs. We also used Flask framework for Python.

## Challenges we ran into
For some of us, it was difficult using APIs, so learning new things as we made the website was interesting and challenging at the same time. We ran into lots of issues like the API connection between Python and HTML. :(

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud that we were able to implement various APIs with Python in order to make our program. We were also proud that we used a different programming language that we were not as used to.

## What we learned
We learned how to use APIs and to collaborate as a team. 

## What's next for Galactic Origins
Weâ€™re definitely looking forward to our next hackathons! Also, we will add some more APIs further in time and make it a more robust website than it has ever been.
